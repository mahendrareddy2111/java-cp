Problem Statement : Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array.

                    A k-diff pair is an integer pair (nums[i], nums[j]), where the following are true:

                        0 <= i, j < nums.length
                        i != j
                        a <= b
                        b - a == k

Time Complexity: worst-case : O(n^2)  when n is the number elements in the array
Space Complexity:O(n)
