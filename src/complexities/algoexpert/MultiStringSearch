Problem Statement : MultiStringSearch

Difficulty : Hard
Category: Trie

Problem Statement: Given a long string and an array of small strings, return an array with boolean value, whether the small string
is part of the longer string

Time Complexity: worst-case : O(b^2+ns)  when b is the length of the longer string and n is the number of small string and
s is the lenght of longest small string.
Space Complexity:O(b^2 + n)
