Difficulty : Medium
Category: Recursion

Problem Statement: Given an array and return its powerset, eg : {1,2,3} powerset of this array is
{{},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}

Worst-Case :
    Time Complexity: worst-case : O((2^n)*n)  when n is the number of elements in the array
    Space Complexity:O((2^n)*n)
