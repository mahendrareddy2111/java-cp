Problem Statement : Suffix Trie construction

Difficulty : Medium
Category: Trie

Problem Statement: Given a source string, construct the suffix trie, and search for a string

Suffix Trie construction :
    Time Complexity: O(n^2)  when n is the length of source string
    Space Complexity:O(n^2)

Searching a string:
    Time Complexity: O(m) where m is the length of string to be searched.
    Space Complexity: O(1)
